# TabMaster
TabMaster will be a desktop application that formats, colors to the user's liking, saves, stores, and sorts your guitar and bass tabs.  The endgame is to had an app that automatically finds the highest rated tab on Ultimate-Guitar.com for the song you are looking for. It will then store the tab in a library so that you dont have to find it more than once.  It will also support manual tab imports for those who write their own tab, and will also let you edit any tab in your library.
